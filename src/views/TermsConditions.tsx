Services; The Interface; Blockchain Fees.
                </Text>
The Website provides methods and information to allow those who access the Website (&quot;Participants&quot;) to access or participate in the HUSKI’s decentralized, autonomous interest rate markets and informational feeds (the &quot;Protocol&quot;) including via the Interface (collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;). The Protocol is intended to be provided and operate in a decentralized manner, meaning that the Company has no ability to control, modify, prevent, stop, amend, or adjust interactions or transactions after they are submitted to the Protocol, whether or not through the Interface, and that the Interface is not the only method that individuals or parties may interact with, contribute to, access, or otherwise affect the Protocol. Consequently, you are expected to be familiar with the Protocol and the risks it represents (including without limitation the possibility of your crypto-assets being forfeited according to the Protocol’s rules or lost for any other reason) before accessing it (whether or not via the Interface). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OR INTERACTION WITH THE PROTOCOL IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THE COMPANY WAIVES ALL LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES RELATED TO THE PROTOCOL, WHETHER OR NOT THE PROTOCOL IS ACCESSED VIA THE SERVICES.

            <Text as="p">
Your full use and enjoyment of the Services (whether or not by using the Interface) may require you to pay transactional fees required by their underlying blockchain or distributed ledger service or that are used to encourage intended use among the Protocol’s participants/ (&quot;Blockchain Fees&quot;). These Blockchain Fees are not levied directly by the Company, but rather are determined by your use of the Services and the rules placed by corresponding Protocol and blockchain communities at large. You acknowledge that the Company has no control over Blockchain Fees, (including, without limitation, their applicability, payment, amounts, transmission, transmission, intended operation, and effectiveness) whether related to your use of the Services or otherwise, and agree that in no event will the Company be responsible to you or any other part for the payment, repayment, refund, disbursement, indemnity, or for any other aspect of your use or transmission of Blockchain Fees.

Nature of Blockchain; Assumption of Risk; Waiver of Claims.
                </Text>            
Blockchains, DEXs, DeFi, oracles, crypto-assets, the Protocol, and their related technologies and functionalities are still emerging innovations that carry a relatively high amount of foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, political, social, and personal safety standpoints. The mere access to and interaction with blockchains requires high degrees of skill and knowledge to operate with a relative degree of safety and proficiency. Crypto-assets are highly volatile in nature due to many diverse factors, including without limitation use and adoption, speculation, manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and application. Further, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies, such as blockchains like those underlying the Protocol, is variable and highly volatile. Moreover, the transparent nature of many blockchains means that any interactions the User has with any blockchain may be publicly visible and readable in human form.
</Text>
            <Text as="p">
                
By accessing and using the Website or the Services, the User acknowledges the foregoing, and agrees and represents that it understands such and other risks involved with blockchains, DeFi, oracles, the Protocol, and related technologies (including without limitation any specific technical language used in this Agreement). The User further represents that it has all knowledge sufficient to work, and is informed of all foreseeable risks, and the possibility of unforeseeable risks, associated with blockchains, crypto-assets, Web3 Utilities, smart contracts, the Interface, APIs, and the Services. The User further acknowledges, and assumes all risk related to the possibility, that any information presented via the Website, Interface, or Services may be inaccurate, possibly due to another party’s malicious activities and possibly to the User’s severe harm or detriment. The User agrees that we are not responsible for any of these or related risks, do not own or control any blockchain or DEX or oracle or the Protocol itself, cannot guarantee the safe or accurate functioning of the Services, and shall not be held liable for any resulting harms, damages, or losses incurred by or against the User experiences while accessing or using the Website or the Services. Accordingly, the User acknowledges the foregoing, represents its understanding of the foregoing, and agrees to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Website and interacting with the Services, whether mentioned in this Section or otherwise. The User further expressly waives and releases us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to the User’s use of the Website and the User’s interaction with the Services.
